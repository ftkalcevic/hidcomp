hidcomp/hidconfig are built against Qt4.5.1 using a static library.

sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev

The LinuxCNC source is required to build hidcomp.  An environment variable,
EMCPATH must be set to point to the emc directory, eg..

export EMCPATH=/home/frankt/emc2.core/emc2-dev


To build, first run...

	qmake

then 

	make

the binaries are in hid/hidcomp/release/hidcomp and 
hid/hidconfig/release/hidconfig.  There is also a debug build.
